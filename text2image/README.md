## 1. Intro to MAF

Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) offers **two** primary categories of capabilities:

* AI agents: Individual agents that use LLMs to process user inputs, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses. Agents support model providers including Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, and Azure AI.
* Workflows: Graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Workflows support type-based routing, nesting, checkpointing, and request/response patterns for human-in-the-loop scenarios.

MAF supports DOTNET and PYTHON SDK. This repository demos the PYTHON SDK samples.

## 2. Quick start
Follow [Quick Start Guide](./quickstart.md) to setup the dev host, creating python project, and run the python sample scripts.
